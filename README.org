* iTerm2 Gruvbox Light Faded
This is my take on a gruvbox light theme for iTerm2 that uses the soft and faded
colors.

Key design choices:
- The theme uses the =OSX HEX= values from [[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib/blob/master/color.table][this table]]. These look better than
   the default hex values.
- Most of the design choices were made because I wanted a more muted appearnce,
   with less stark contrasts.
  + Bold uses =dark1= instead of a white.
  + The normal colors use the =faded_*= variants.
  + The bright colors use the =neutral_*= variants.
  + The background uses =light0_soft=.
  + The cursor guide uses the =light0_hard= to create a subtle indication.
- I like more contrast for selection scenarios and the white color so the
   selection, cursor text, and normal white colors use =light0_hard=.

** [[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib][morhetz/gruvbox-contrib]]
A collection of many ports of gruvbox that includes a dark and light variant for
iTerm2. It is maintained by the creator of gruvbox, so I consider this the
canonical implementation.

** [[https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes][iTerm2-Color-Schemes]]
A very comprehensive collection of iTerm2 themes and has a dark and light variant.

A wonderfully implemented gruvbox dark theme.
